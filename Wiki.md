## Introduction 



## Initial Inspiration 


## Version 1

Released in January of 1994, functional programming was officially up and running. This version included functional programming 
like map, Lambda, filter and reduce features as well as previous features from the 0.9 Python version. Those features included classes with 
inheritance, core data types, exception handling and functions. Python version 1.4 was when Modula-3 style keyword arguments were released as well 
as support for complex number operations. The following versions of Python 1 were license updates, background changes and other optimizations. 
Python version 1.6 released the year of 2000, was the last update developed at CNRI and the only version with an open source license that was 
released by the CNRI. 


## Version 2 

In introducing Python 2 which was brought to the technology world in 2000 created by BeOpen with main purpose for making programming simple with the 
ease for learning the program. Python 2 made code development easier than the earlier versions. Python 2 is an object oriented programming language
as a high level language as the translation of Python code takes place into machine language, thus, using an intepreter.

Python 2 an open source version helps the DevOps engineer with configuration management tools. The history of Python 2.0 ranges from October 16, 2000
to July 3, 2010 ending with Python 2.7. The syntax of Python 2 was noted to be difficult to understand along with rules of ordering comparison that are
very complex. Lisewise, Python version 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2. Also older libraries created for Python 2 is not forward-compatible.
Python 2 is not forward-compatible. Python 2 is not available after 2020. In summary Python 2 made the code development process much easier than its
earlier versions in comparison. See below the key different between Python 2 and Python 3 which determined the fate of Python2 ending in 2020.
